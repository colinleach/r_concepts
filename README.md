# r_concepts

The [R track on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/r) currently lacks a Learning Syllabus, designed to lead novices to the language through a sequence of key concepts. Implementing this is nobody's priority right now, but this repo is an attempt to think about how it might one day look. It should be emphasized that this is just one person doodling: there is no expectation that it will be merged into the [Exercism/R](https://github.com/exercism/r) repo any time soon.

One table of possible concepts is laid out in [issue #198](https://github.com/exercism/r/issues/198)

Each concept has its own subdirectory under `concepts/`. There should eventually be 2 documents in each:
- `introduction.md`: provides a brief introduction to a student who has not yet completed the corresponding concept exercise
- `about.md:` provides more detailed information about the concept, for a student who has completed the corresponding concept exercise to learn from and refer back to

Eventually, exercises illustrating and practicing each concept will need to be created. These go under `exercises/concept/`, each in their own subdirectory.
