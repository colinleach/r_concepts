# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about using random values in R.

## Learning objectives

- Understand `sample()`, with and without replacement.
- Understand `runif()` to get uniformly-distributed floating-point numbers.
- Be aware of some other random distributions, not used here.

## Out of scope

- Details of all the options used in statistical modeling. R has *many* of these.

## Concepts

This exercise unlocks no other concepts.

## Prerequisites

- `strings`
