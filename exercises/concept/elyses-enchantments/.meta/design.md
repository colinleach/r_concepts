# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of (atomic) vectors in R.

## Learning objectives

- Know that a vector (for this lesson assumed to be an *atomic* vector) is a homogeneous collection.
- Know how to create vectors with `c()` and `vector()`.
- Understand ranges and `seq()`.
- Understand the basics of arithmetic using vectors.
- Understand the basics of subsetting with `[]`, knowing that R uses 1-based indexing.
- Know what negative indices do.
- Know the use of conditionals to create boolean vectors, and their use with `all()` and `any()`

## Out of scope

- Creation with mode-specific functions such as `logical()`.
- Recycling (will be introduced in `vector-filtering`).
- More advanced subsetting.
- Most vector functions.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `vector-filtering`
- `lists`
- `strings`
- `set-operations`

## Prerequisites

- `conditionals`
